======================================
 	  ABSTRACT DATA TYPE
======================================

/	Definition	/
> a Mathematical Model together with various operations defined on that Model
	- set of integers
	- Operations: Union, Intersection, Set Difference
	- ADT List, ADT Stack, ADT Queue
> behavior is defined by a set of value and a set of operations
> called "ABSTRACT" == gives an implementation-independent view


/	   Operations		/
a. Initialize(List) 
	- prepares list to be used the first time
b. Insert(List, elem, position) 
	- Insert elem at pos of list
c. Delete(List, position)
	- Deletes the element at position of list
d. Located(List, elem)
	- return the position of elem in list
e. Retrieve(List, position)
	- return element at position of list


/	 Implementation		/
1. Array Implementation
     > Advantage
	- New elements can be added only to the tail 
	- List is easily traversable only by the index or count element 
     > Disadvantage
	- Inserting
		- inserting in middle of list needs shifting all the elements
		  after the position of the element just to make room 
	- Deleting
		-also requires shifting of elements to close gap 
		- EXCEPT: when deleting the last element 
     > VERSIONS
	(v1) List is a structure containing an array of elem and a count or last
	(v2) List is a Pointer to a structure w/ array and count/last
	(v3) List is structure w/ a pointer to a dynamic array and count/last
	(v4) List 
2. Linked List
	a. by pointers
		i.  pass-by-copy
		ii. pass-by-address
3. Cursor Based Implementation
